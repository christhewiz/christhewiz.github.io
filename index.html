<h1>Chris Collins</h1>
<h2>Musician and Athlete</h2>
<br>
<p>
    My name is Chris Collins and I'm 15 years old. I go to Hoffman Estates high School. I do gymnastics and I wrestle at Hoffman.
    I'm also in a band called Grash Tang, which I'm the lead vocalist and secondary guitarist for.
    I also skateboard, ride BMX, and have a passion for photography.
</p>
<p>
    You can find our band on SoundCloud under the name of Grash Tang, and we will be
    releasing our first album at the end of the year.
